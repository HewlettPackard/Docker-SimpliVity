# Summary

This document has described how to architect and deploy a Docker CaaS platform on HPE SimpliVity, using Ansible playbooks to quickly install and deploy a production ready container environment. This deployment includes a highly available container cluster with backup services and persistent data support. This solution is ideal for customers looking to run containers on VMs to take advantage of the resource efficient usage of virtual machines for Docker containers, and having the ability to run legacy and new container applications side-by-side. Customers deploying Docker containers on a large scale, on Linux and Microsoft Windows, should consider HPE SimpliVity as the deployment infrastructure.
