# Intro to Express Containers

HPE Express Containers with Docker Enterprise Edition on HPE SimpliVity is a complete solution from Hewlett Packard Enterprise that includes all the hardware, software, professional services, and support you need to deploy a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform, allowing you to get up and running quickly and efficiently. The solution takes HPE SimpliVity infrastructure and combines it with Docker’s enterprise-grade container platform, popular open source tools, along with deployment and advisory services from HPE Pointnext.

HPE Express Containers with Docker Enterprise Edition on HPE SimpliVity is ideal for customers migrating legacy applications to containers, transitioning to a container DevOps development model or needing a hybrid environment to support container and non-containerized applications on a common VM platform. This Reference Configuration provides a solution for IT operations, addressing the need for a production-ready environment that is easy to deploy and manage.

This release supports Kubernetes via Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) 2.0, which is the only platform that manages and secures applications on Kubernetes in multi-Linux, multi-OS and multi-cloud customer environments. This document describes the best practices for deploying and operating HPE Enterprise Containers as a Service with Docker Enterprise Edition (EE). It shows how to automate the provisioning of the environment using a set of Ansible playbooks. It also outlines a set of manual steps to harden, secure and audit the overall status of the system.
