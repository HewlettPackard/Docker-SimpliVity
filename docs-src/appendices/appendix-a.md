# Appendix A: Bill of Materials

The following BOM contains electronic license to use (E-LTU) parts. Electronic software license delivery is now available in most 
countries. HPE recommends purchasing electronic products over physical products (when available) for faster delivery and for the 
convenience of not tracking and managing confidential paper licenses. For more information, please contact your reseller or 
an HPE representative.

**Note:** Part numbers are at time of publication and subject to change. The bill of materials does not include complete 
support options or other rack and power requirements. If you have questions regarding ordering, please consult 
with your HPE Reseller or HPE Sales Representative for more details.
