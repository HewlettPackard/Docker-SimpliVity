# Security

The Docker Reference architecture for Securing Docker EE and Security Best Practices is available at [https://success.docker.com/article/Docker_Reference_Architecture-_Securing_Docker_EE_and_Security_Best_Practices](https://success.docker.com/article/Docker_Reference_Architecture-_Securing_Docker_EE_and_Security_Best_Practices).

In addition to having all logs centralized in a single place and the image scanning feature enabled for the DTR nodes, there are other guidelines that should be followed in order to keep your Docker environment as secure as possible. The HPE Reference Configuration paper for securing Docker on HPE Hardware places a special emphasis on securing Docker in DevOps environments and covers best practices in terms of Docker security. The document can be found at [http://h20195.www2.hpe.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=a00020437enw](http://h20195.www2.hpe.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=a00020437enw).

In addition, the Sysdig product also provides a strong level of container security and monitoring (see section `Monitoring with Sysdig`).
